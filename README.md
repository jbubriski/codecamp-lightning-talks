# Boston Code Camp Lightning Talks

Got a great open source project you want people to know about? Solved a cool problem and want to brag? Want to rant about something? You've got the floor for up to 8 minutes (depending on how many people submit talks).

You'll be timed. To avoid any delays your slides should be sent as a PR to this git repo. Make a directory for your talk, the directory name should be the title of your talk. 

I'll update the session info with the first 10 PRs that get submitted. 1 submission per person pls to make things easier.

Talks will be run off of a windows laptop, so, you know, slides should run on that (powerpoint is cool).
